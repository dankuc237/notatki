# Android Debug Bridge (adb)

command-line tool that lets you communicate with a device. provides access to a Unix shell that you can use to run a variety of commands on a device  
https://developer.android.com/tools/adb  
adb is included in the Android SDK Platform Tools package. Download this package with the SDK Manager, which installs it at android_sdk/platform-tools/. If you want the standalone Android SDK Platform Tools package, download it here.  
To use adb with a device connected over USB, **you must enable USB debugging** in the device system settings, under Developer options.  
verify that your device is connected by executing

```bash
adb devices
```

from the android_sdk/platform-tools/ directory.

# Install an app

You can use adb to install an APK on an emulator or connected device with the install command:

```
adb install path_to_apk
```

# Set up port forwarding

Use the forward command to set up arbitrary port forwarding, which forwards requests on a specific host port to a different port on a device. The following example sets up forwarding of host port 6100 to device port 7100:

```
adb forward tcp:6100 tcp:7100
```

The following example sets up forwarding of host port 6100 to local:logd:

```
adb forward tcp:6100 local:logd
```

This could be useful if you are trying to detemine what is being sent to a given port on the device. All received data will be written to the system-logging daemon and displayed in the device logs.

# Copy files to and from a device

To copy a file or directory and its sub-directories from the device, do the following:

```
adb pull remote local
```

To copy a file or directory and its sub-directories to the device, do the following:

```
adb push local remote
```

Replace local and remote with the paths to the target files/directory on your development machine (local) and on the device (remote). For example:

```
adb push myfile.txt /sdcard/myfile.txt
```

# Stop the adb server

To stop the adb server, use the

```
adb kill-server
```

You can then restart the server by issuing **any other adb command**.

# Issue shell commands

To issue a single command, use the shell command like this:

```
adb [-d |-e | -s serial_number] shell shell_command
```

To start an interactive shell on a device, use the shell command like this:

```
adb [-d | -e | -s serial_number] shell
```

# Call activity manager

Within an adb shell, you can issue commands with the activity manager (am) tool to perform various system actions, such as start an activity, force-stop a process, broadcast an intent, modify the device screen properties, and more.

While in a shell, the am syntax is:

```
am command
```

You can also issue an activity manager command directly from adb without entering a remote shell. For example:

```
adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW
```

# Read ART profiles for apps
Android Runtime (ART) collects execution profiles for installed apps, which are used to optimize app performance.  
*Note: It is only possible to retrieve the execution profile filename if you have root access to the file system, for example, on an emulator.*

To produce a text form of the profile information, use the following command:
```
adb shell cmd package dump-profiles package
```
To retrieve the file produced, use:
```
adb pull /data/misc/profman/package.prof.txt
```
# Reset test devices

to remove user data and reset the test environment. You can perform a factory reset of a test device running Android 10 (API level 29) or higher using the testharness adb shell command, as shown:
```
adb shell cmd testharness enable
```
